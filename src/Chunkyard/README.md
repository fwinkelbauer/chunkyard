Chunkyard is a fast backup application for Windows and Linux which stores files in a content addressable storage with support for dynamic chunking and encryption.

The [FastCDC](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc16/atc16-paper-xia.pdf) chunking algorithm is a C# port of the Rust crate [fastcdc-rs](https://github.com/nlfiedler/fastcdc-rs).
